# GOPH_419_F2025_Lab_2
# Iterative Linear Solvers and Spline Interpolation

This respository contains the complete implementation for Lab2 of GOPH 419, Fall 2025
The objectives of this lab were to:

1. Implement an interative linear system solver using both Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi algorithms.
2. Implement piecwise polynomial spline interpolation of order 1 (linear), order 2 (quadratic), and order 3 (cubic).
3. Use these implementations to interpolate empirical datasets of water density and air density as functions of temperature.
4. Validate correctness through unit tests and generate plots comparing behaviour.

This repository includes:
- Python implementation ('linalg_interp.py')
- Unit tests ('Tests.py')
- Driver scripts to generate plots ('driver.py')
- Data files
